title: Godot - Map II

The summer is a busy season for us, so I wish I had more time for coding. I've been playing around with the map code for a short while.

<h3>High-Level Map</h3>
For the high-level components of the map, I add an sphere surface function to a simplex noise, to generate something that resembles an island. The high-level components of the map can be shown independently, as shown in the screenshot below:

<h3>Low-Level Map</h3>
For the low-level components of the map, I add the high-level components to a couple of Simplex functions to generate noise. The low-level components of the map must be generated before being visible. In the screenshot below, I've moved around the map quite a bit, loading terrain tiles to generate it:
