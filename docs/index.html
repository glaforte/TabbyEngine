<p>I am Guillaume Laforte, I have twenty years working on diverse applications, mainly in C++ with a deep understanding of the 3D modeling tools, rendering and tool pipelines for the entertainment and simulation industries.  I've proven to be a very fast and clean coder. Lately, I've been focusing my efforts on a new project built with the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>. This blog presents my experiments in various technical fields: rendering, meta-object programming, game development...</p>
