title: TEngine v0.0.8

I have now tagged v0.0.8 of the TEngine on my repository. I was focusing on a new processing and packaging pipeline. The result is the TPacker application and a new asset/package system. Here's a screenshot.

I'm happy with the development of the asset and packages. In all cases, I was able to avoid circular architectural dependencies, using meta-object programming. Even the UI elements, built in QML, are not sourced directly by the asset editor. Instead, they register themselves using the high-level asset's meta-object. The asset editor retrieves the registered editor and then blindly sources the referred QML.

Using meta-object programming properly, it is possible to avoid large and clunky serialization functions, dynamic UI edition functions.
